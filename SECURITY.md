# Security policy

We take the security of this project seriously and appreciate responsible disclosures.

## Supported Versions

We provide support exclusively for the [latest version](https://github.com/world-federation-of-advertisers/cross-media-measurement/releases/latest), as we follow a develop-at-HEAD policy. Security fixes are applied only to the current version and are not backported to older releases.

## Vulnerability Tracking Policy

We track and address only vulnerabilities rated HIGH or higher in the [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov).
For vulnerabilities affecting upstream dependencies, we rely entirely on upstream maintainers to provide fixes and do not independently patch or maintain forks of those dependencies.
