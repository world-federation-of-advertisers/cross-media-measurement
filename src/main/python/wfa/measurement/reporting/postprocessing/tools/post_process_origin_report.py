  Processes a ReportSummary and corrects the measurements.

  This class takes a ReportSummary as input and performs the following steps:
  1. Extracts cumulative and whole campaign measurements from the ReportSummary.
  2. Extracts unique reach measurements from the ReportSummary.
  3. Processes the measurements in the ReportSummary so that they are
     consistent.
