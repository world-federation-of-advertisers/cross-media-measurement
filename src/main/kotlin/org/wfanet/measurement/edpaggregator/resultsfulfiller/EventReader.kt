   * This suspend function initiates the event reading process and returns a [Flow] that emits

   *
   * The returned flow is cold, meaning the reading operation starts when collection begins and can
   * be collected multiple times if needed.
   *
   * ## Error Handling
   *
   * Implementations must throw [ImpressionReadException] with appropriate error codes:
   * - [ImpressionReadException.Code.BLOB_NOT_FOUND] when the data source doesn't exist
   * - [ImpressionReadException.Code.INVALID_FORMAT] when data cannot be parsed
   *
   * @return a cold [Flow] that emits lists of [LabeledEvent] instances. Each list represents a
   *   batch of events, with batch size determined by the implementation's batching strategy.
   * @throws ImpressionReadException if the data source cannot be accessed, authentication fails, or
   *   the data format is invalid
   * @throws IllegalStateException if the reader is not properly configured
