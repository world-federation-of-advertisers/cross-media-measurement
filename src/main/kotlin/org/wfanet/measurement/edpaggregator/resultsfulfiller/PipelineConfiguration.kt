/**
 * Configuration for the event processing pipeline.
 *
 * This data class encapsulates all configuration parameters needed to run
 * the pipeline, making it easier to pass configuration between components.
 *
 * @property batchSize Number of events to process in each batch. Batching reduces processing
 *     overhead and improves throughput. Typical values range from 128 to 1024 events per batch.
 * @property channelCapacity Per-worker channel capacity in number of batches. Provides backpressure
 *     to prevent unbounded memory growth. With default capacity of 128 batches and ~256 KiB per
 *     batch (assuming ~1 KiB per event and 256 events/batch), each worker can buffer ~32 MiB.
 * @property threadPoolSize Size of the thread pool for the coroutine dispatcher. Should be tuned
 *     based on available CPU cores and expected workload characteristics.
 * @property workers Number of parallel worker coroutines for processing batches. Workers process
 *     assigned batches in parallel via round-robin distribution. For CPU-bound workloads, optimal
 *     performance is typically achieved with workers equal to or slightly above
 *     CPU core count (e.g., CPU cores + 1 or 2).
