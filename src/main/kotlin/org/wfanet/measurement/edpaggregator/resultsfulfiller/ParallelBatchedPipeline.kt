/**
 * Parallel, batched implementation of the event processing pipeline with **structured concurrency**
 * and **bounded backpressure**.
 *
 * ## Overview
 *
 * This pipeline uses a two-stage parallel architecture that overlaps production and consumption.
 *
 * ### Stage 1: Batch Collection and Distribution
 * - Collects pre-batched events from the upstream flow.
 * - Sends batches to per-worker channels in **strict round-robin** order.
 *     - `send` **suspends** (does not block the thread) when a worker’s channel is full, providing
 *       backpressure.
 *     - **Always closes all worker channels in a `finally` block** to guarantee worker termination
 *       on upstream completion, failure, or cancellation.
 *
 * ### Stage 2: Parallel Processing Workers
 * - Worker coroutines run in parallel and **consume until their channel is closed and drained**.
 * - Each worker processes its batch through **all** sinks sequentially (better cache locality).
 * - If a worker fails, the enclosing scope cancels siblings (structured concurrency).
 *
 * ### Key Components:
 * - **FrequencyVectorSink**: Filters/aggregates events into frequency vectors.
 * - **Channels**: Per-worker, bounded queues enabling round-robin distribution and backpressure.
 *
 * ### Processing Flow:
 * ```
 * EventSource -> RoundRobin -> Worker[1] -> Sinks[1..M]
 *                           -> Worker[2] -> Sinks[1..M]
 *                           -> Worker[N] -> Sinks[1..M]
 * ```
 *
 * ### Performance Characteristics:
 * - Batching reduces per-item overhead.
 * - Parallel workers maximize CPU utilization; producer/consumer run concurrently.
 * - Note: strict round-robin can stall on a slow worker if its channel fills (fairness trade-off).

   * Per-worker channel capacity, in batches.
   *
   * Rationale: A bounded capacity provides backpressure so that if processing slows down, upstream
   * batch production does not grow without bound.
   *
   * Memory model (rule of thumb): assume ~1 KiB per event and batches of 256 events. That is ~256
   * KiB per batch. With the default capacity of [DEFAULT_WORKER_CHANNEL_CAPACITY] (128), a single
   * worker can buffer ~32 MiB of batch payload (128 × 256 KiB). Across `N` workers the pipeline
   * would buffer roughly `N × 32 MiB` of batch payload, plus object overhead. This balances
   * smoothing producer/consumer jitter with bounding memory.
