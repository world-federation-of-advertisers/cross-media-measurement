-- Cloud Spanner database schema for metric values in a Duchy.
--
-- IDs not marked as resource or external are internal to the database. Only
-- external IDs should be exposed outside of the binary that controls the
-- database, e.g. via services or user interfaces.
--
-- Resource IDs are IDs in the external resource-oriented API. As the Duchy does
-- not generate any of these IDs, it can make no assumptions about them other
-- than what is defined in the API contract. In particular, the only guarantee
-- about the ID format is that it is a URL-safe string. Furthermore, resource
-- IDs are only guaranteed to be unique among their siblings under the same
-- parent.

-- TODO(wangyaopw): delete this table when v2alpha is done.
-- Represents `MetricValue` API resources.
