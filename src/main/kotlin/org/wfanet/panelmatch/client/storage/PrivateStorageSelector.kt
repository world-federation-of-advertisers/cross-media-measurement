 * As not all types of StorageClients are expected to be supported by all EDPs and MPs, this gives
 * each party the option to not depend on a StorageFactory they choose not to support.
 *
 * @param[storageDetailsProvider] provides access to all information required to build private
 * storage for all active exchanges. These are expected to be configured by a party at the time an
 * exchange is first built and stored securely. This SecretMap is the abstraction used to retrieve
 * those credentials.
