# OpenTelemetry Collector configuration for Cloud Run

# Exports metrics to Google Cloud Monitoring

receivers:

    protocols:
      # Using gRPC on port 8080 per Cloud Run requirements
      # Rationale:
      # - Cloud Run expects services to listen on the PORT environment variable (default: 8080)
      # - Cloud Run terminates TLS and routes HTTPS:443 -> HTTP/2:8080 for gRPC
      # - Clients connect to the service URL on port 443 (standard HTTPS)
      # - Reference: https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/triggering/grpc
