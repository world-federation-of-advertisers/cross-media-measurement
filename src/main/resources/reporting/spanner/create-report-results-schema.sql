-- comment: Create ReportResults tables and make them usable for BasicReport results

START BATCH DDL;

-- There is one in memory table that provides an GroupingDimensionFingerprint
-- for use in the tables below as a join key.
--
-- This field is a 64-bit integer that represents a combination of grouping dimensions.
-- For example if we have age bucket and gender dimensions each combination of their
-- values is assigned a unique integer. For example the combination (AGE_18_24, F)
-- is assigned a unique integer as does (AGE_18_24, null), in which case this includes
-- al values of the gender dimension in the grouping.
-- This allows for two things:
 --   1. a more efficient join of results
 --   2. a way to easily track versions of Event Templates
 -- The fingerprint considers the combination of dimension values as well as the Event Template
 -- version.

-- This table is the root for all of the Results associated with a Basic Report and in the
-- future an Advanced Report or Report Cube.
