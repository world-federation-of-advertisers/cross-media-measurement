    //      are defined as the intersection of the Reporting Unit's Media Types
    //      and the report's Media Type filters. This is called the scoped Media
    //      Type. For exmaple, if a Reporting
    //      Unit has MediaType=[VIDEO, DISPLAY] and the report has a
    //      MediaType filter = [VIDEO], then the scoped Media Type of the
    //      Reporting Unit is VIDEO.
    //   2. If the scoped Media Type of a Reporting Unit intersects the Media
    //   Types of
    //      a filter catetory then the scoped Media Types of the Reporting Unit
    //      must be equal to or a proper subset of this filter's MediaTypes.
    //      Otherwise, if there is an intersection it is an error. This is to
    //      avoid omitting impressions that might otherwise be expected to be
    //      counted.
    //   3. If the scoped Media Type of a Reporting Unit does not intersect with
    //      the filter's MediaTypes then the metrics computed using that filter
    //      do not include that Reporting Set.
