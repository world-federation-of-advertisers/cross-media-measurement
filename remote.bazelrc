# Depending on how many machines are in the remote execution instance, setting
# this higher can make builds faster by allowing more jobs to run in parallel.
# Setting it too high can result in jobs that timeout, however, while waiting
# for a remote machine to execute them.
build:remote --jobs=200

# Include container toolchain/platform configuration.
build:remote --config=container

# Starting with Bazel 0.27.0 strategies do not need to be explicitly
# defined. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7480
build:remote --define=EXECUTOR=remote

# Enable remote execution so actions are performed on the remote systems.
build:remote --remote_executor=grpcs://remotebuildexecution.googleapis.com

# Enforce stricter environment rules, which eliminates some non-hermetic
# behavior and therefore improves both the remote cache hit rate and the
# correctness and repeatability of the build.
build:remote --incompatible_strict_action_env=true

# Set a higher timeout value, just in case.
build:remote --remote_timeout=3600

# Enable caching.
build:remote --remote_cache=remotebuildexecution.googleapis.com

# Enable authentication. This will pick up application default credentials by
# default. You can use --google_credentials=some_file.json to use a service
# account credential instead.
build:remote --google_default_credentials=true
