# Building

The measurement system can be built using [Bazel](https://www.bazel.build/). The
resulting container images are intended to run in
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) (K8s).

## Requirements

In order to build the primary system executables and run the corresponding
tests, your build environment must meet the following:

*   Bazel
    *   Known to work with Bazel 4.0.0
*   GNU/Linux OS with x86-64 architecture
    *   Known to work on Debian Bullseye and Ubuntu 18.04
*   [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)
*   [SWIG](http://swig.org/)
*   Bash
*   OpenSSL 1.1.1+

The executable dependencies must be in your `$PATH`.

The entire suite of tests can be run using the following command:

```shell
bazel test //src/test/...
```

### MacOS

To build on MacOS you need to run the bazel build/test in a docker container using
`tools/bazel-container build "//..."`

fyi, currently using the docker build clashes with running the bazel build locally on your computer.


### IntelliJ Setup

As of early June 2021, these steps work to get code completion working for Intellij:
- use IntelliJ 2021.1.2 and the beta build of the Bazel Plugin
    - Add `https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/list?channel=beta` to your list of plugin repos ([source](https://github.com/bazelbuild/intellij/issues/2406))
- Start a new project from scratch in IntelliJ by selecting "Import Bazel Project" and open the base dir of the cross-media-measurement repo
    - Uncomment "Kotlin" when creating the .bazelproject file
- Once the new projected is created, the Bazel plugin will kick off a sync and, after a while, IntelliJ should start detecting all dependencies and index them. Ignore the Bazel output errors, they happen because e.g. the Spanner Emulator can only be build on Linux.

On MacOS not all targets are supported for building but you can run most Kotlin tests (with some exceptions, e.g. TransportSecurityTest.kt doesn't work because of openssl incompatibilities) by directly invoking a particular test: `bazel test "//src/test/kotlin/org/wfanet/measurement/common/identity/..."` or similar.


### Local Kubernetes

You can bring up a minimal testing environment in a local Kubernetes environment
using either [Usernetes](https://github.com/rootless-containers/usernetes) (U7s)
with containerd or [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/). Use one of the following
commands:

```shell
bazel run //src/main/k8s:kingdom_and_three_duchies_u7s
```

```shell
bazel run //src/main/k8s:kingdom_and_three_duchies_kind
```

### Custom Docker Images

See [Docker Image Targets](../src/main/docker/README.md) for additional
requirements to build/deploy these.
