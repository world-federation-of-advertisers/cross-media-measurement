# Gaussian Noise and ACDP Composition in PBM

Use Gaussian Differential Privacy(DP) noise for Multi-Party Computation(MPC) and
direct measurements, and Almost Concentrated Differential Privacy(ACDP)
composition mechanism in Privacy Budget Manager(PBM) to improve privacy
accounting. Gaussian noise and ACDP composition can support more than 2x queries
with the same privacy budget compared to Laplace noise and Advanced composition
in some parameter settings. It also enables the Measurement Consumer to change
their per-query epsilon, delta values arbitrarily, which improves flexibility of
privacy budgeting.

## Rollout Steps

To enable Gaussian noise and ACDP composition in the system:

1.  Change `noise_mechanism` to `DISCRETE_GAUSSIAN` in
    [llv2_protocol_config_config.textproto](../../src/main/k8s/testing/secretfiles/llv2_protocol_config_config.textproto)
    in Kingdom for LLV2 based MPC reach and frequency measurement
2.  Change `noise_mechanism` to `DISCRETE_GAUSSIAN` in
    [ro_llv2_protocol_config_config.textproto](../../src/main/k8s/testing/secretfiles/ro_llv2_protocol_config_config.textproto)
    in Kingdom for LLV2 based MPC reach only measurement
3.  Change `compositionMechanism` flag to `ACDP` in
    [EDPSimulatorFlags.kt](../../src/main/kotlin/org/wfanet/measurement/loadtest/dataprovider/EdpSimulatorFlags.kt)
    to start using ACDP composition in PBM. This change also requires EDP to use
    Gaussian noise for direct measuremens. The Gaussian noiser implementation is
    provided in
    `src/main/kotlin/org/wfanet/measurement/eventdataprovider/noiser/GaussianNoiser.kt`

## Verification

When PBM is using ACDP compsoition and `noise_mechanism` passed in
`ProtocolConfig.Protocol.LiquidLegionsV2` in MPC requisition is not
`DISCRETE_GAUSSIAN`, the requisition will be refused. The following code snippet
can be used to verify the `noise_mechanism`:

```kotlin
val llv2Protocol: ProtocolConfig.Protocol =
        requireNotNull(requisition.protocolConfig.protocolsList.find { protocol -> protocol.hasLiquidLegionsV2() })
val liquidLegionsV2: ProtocolConfig.LiquidLegionsV2 = llv2Protocol.liquidLegionsV2
val llv2NoiseMechanism = liquidLegionsV2.noiseMechanism
```

`llv2NoiseMechanism` should be `DISCRETE_GAUSSIAN`.

The changes can also be validated with logs in EDP simulator through integration
tests:

```shell
INFO:  chargeLiquidLegionsV2PrivacyBudget with ACDP composition mechanism for requisition with DISCRETE_GAUSSIAN noise mechanism...
```

```shell
INFO:  chargeDirectPrivacyBudget with ACDP composition mechanism...
```

## Kingdom Operator and EDP with PBM

For MPC Gaussian noise, the config files in the above Rollout Steps are part of
the testing secrets and are only used by the Halo dev environment. The Kingdom
operators write/maintain these config files themselves don't automatically get
updates when upgrading to a new release. The Kingdom operators need to update
their own llv2_protocol_config_config.textproto and
ro_llv2_protocol_config_config.textproto files in their K8s settings(1. and 2.
in Rollout Steps).

For EDP running their own PBM, they need to follow the reference implementation
provided in the PBM library and EDP simulator to implement the Gaussian noiser
for direct measurements and their own ACDP PBM.

## Emergency Rollback

The Gaussian DP noise and PBM ACDP composition features are designed with
backward compatibility. If thereâ€™s a need to rollback the changes, follow
Rollout Steps to revert back the config flags.
