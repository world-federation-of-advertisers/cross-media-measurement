# Enabling Gaussian Noise and ACDP Composition in PBM

This guide describes how to enable Gaussian Differential Privacy(DP) noise for
Multi-Party Computation(MPC) and direct measurements, and Almost Concentrated
Differential Privacy(ACDP) composition mechanism in Privacy Budget Manager(PBM)
to improve privacy accounting. Gaussian noise and ACDP composition can support
more than 2x queries with the same privacy budget compared to Laplace noise and
advanced composition in some parameter settings. It also enables the Measurement
Consumer to change their per-query epsilon, delta values arbitrarily, which
improves flexibility of privacy budgeting.

## Steps

### Prerequisites

Before enabling Gaussian noise in the Kingdom, it is important to ensure that
all Events Data Providers(EDPs) who implement a PBM are capable of accounting
for Gaussian noise. They should also have implemented ACDP, but if they have
not, they should be comfortable with Gaussian noise allowing fewer queries than
Laplace noise.

All EDPs with PBM using ACDP composition should support adding continuous
Gaussian noise to their direct measurements. The Gaussian noiser implementation
is provided in
[`GaussianNoiser.kt`](../../src/main/kotlin/org/wfanet/measurement/eventdataprovider/noiser/GaussianNoiser.kt)

### Configure MPC protocols to use discrete Gaussian noise in Kingdom

1.  Change `noise_mechanism` to `DISCRETE_GAUSSIAN` in the Kingdom's
    `Llv2ProtocolConfigConfig` for LLV2 based MPC reach and frequency
    measurement. In the `dev` configuration, this is read from the
    `llv2_protocol_config_config.textproto` file in the `certs-and-configs`
    Kubernetes secret.
2.  Change `noise_mechanism` to `DISCRETE_GAUSSIAN` in the Kingdom's
    `RoLlv2ProtocolConfigConfig` for LLV2 based MPC reach only measurement. In
    the `dev` configuration, this is read from the
    `ro_llv2_protocol_config_config.textproto` file in the `certs-and-configs`
    Kubernetes secret.

### Ensure continuous Gaussian noise for direct protocol in Kingdom

For direct measurements, ensure `CONTINUOUS_GAUSSIAN` is enabled for the Direct
protocol in Kingdom. By default, both `CONTINUOUS_GAUSSIAN` and
`CONTINUOUS_LAPLACE` are enabled. The prerequisite is EDPs reading possible
noise mechanisms from ProtocolConfig.

### EDPs with ACDP PBM

1.  When a Kingdom is configured to use discrete Gaussian noise for MPC
    requisitions, EDPs with PBM should update their requisition fulfillment
    pipelines to use ACDP composition.

    Note: If you have a testing environment with EDP simulators, you can update
    those simulators to use ACDP by setting the value of the
    `--composition-mechanism` option to `ACDP`.

2.  Changing to ACDP composition also requires EDP to use continuous Gaussian
    noise for direct measurements.

3.  Note that in the PBM ACDP reference implementation, ACDP composition will
    write privacy charges to a new table(PrivacyBucketAcdpCharges) which is
    effectively resetting the ledger.

## Verification

When PBM is using ACDP composition, and the `noise_mechanism` passed in
`ProtocolConfig.Protocol.LiquidLegionsV2` in MPC requisition is not
`DISCRETE_GAUSSIAN`, the requisition will be refused. The following code snippet
can be used to verify the `noise_mechanism`:

```kotlin
val llv2Protocol: ProtocolConfig.Protocol =
        requireNotNull(requisition.protocolConfig.protocolsList.find { protocol -> protocol.hasLiquidLegionsV2() })
val liquidLegionsV2: ProtocolConfig.LiquidLegionsV2 = llv2Protocol.liquidLegionsV2
val llv2NoiseMechanism = liquidLegionsV2.noiseMechanism
```

`llv2NoiseMechanism` should be `DISCRETE_GAUSSIAN`.

The noise and composition mechanisms changes can also be validated with logs in
EDP simulator through integration tests:

```shell
INFO:  chargeLiquidLegionsV2PrivacyBudget with ACDP composition mechanism for requisition with DISCRETE_GAUSSIAN noise mechanism...
```

```shell
INFO:  chargeDirectPrivacyBudget with ACDP composition mechanism...
```

The `ProtocolConfig` can also be verified in `MeasurementDetails` in the
`Measurements` table in Kingdom.

## Emergency Rollback

The Gaussian noise and PBM ACDP composition features are designed with backward
compatibility. If thereâ€™s a need to roll back the changes, follow Steps to
revert back the configs.

Note that in the PBM ACDP reference implementation, ACDP composition will write
privacy charges to a different table(PrivacyBucketAcdpCharges) from the current
PrivacyBucketCharges table. Rolling back on the EDP side has the effect of
dropping all the ACDP privacy charges.
