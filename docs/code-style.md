# Code Style

## Languages

### Kotlin

We mostly adhere to the
[Google Android Kotlin style guide](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/style-guide).
The one exception is that we use two spaces instead of four for indentation.

In addition to the style guide, please observe these guidelines:

1.  Write unit tests for all code.
    1.  Please only mock interfaces and abstract classes in tests.
    1.  Write test cases per behavior. Bias towards more, smaller test cases.
1.  Avoid third-party libraries where possible. Due to the privacy requirements
    of this project, we prefer avoiding unaudited dependencies.
1.  Avoid weirdness.
    1.  Don't unnecessarily define infix functions.
    1.  Avoid reflection.
    1.  Keep code predictable. If a code reviewer struggles to understand it,
        please add comments or refactor it to be clearer.

### Bazel BUILD and Starlark

Follow the Bazel
[BUILD style guide](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/build-style.html)
and
[.bzl style guide](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/bzl-style.html)

### Protocol Buffers

Follow the
[Protocol Buffers style guide](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style).

### Markdown

Follow the
[Google Markdown Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/style.html).

Note: We intend to keep our Markdown compatible with both the
[GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/) and
[Gitiles](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gitiles/+/HEAD/Documentation/markdown.md).

## Formatters/Linters

Automated formatters help keep code styling consistent, especially when there
are ambiguities in the style guide. You should run the appropriate formatters on
your code prior to submitting.

### Kotlin

Kotlin formatting is done by
[`ktfmt`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/ktfmt) with the `--google-style`
option. Please keep code `ktlint`-formatted.

[`ktlint`](https://ktlint.github.io/) is the Kotlin linter, which also has the
ability to automatically apply some fixes. Our `.editorconfig` file has the
appropriate settings to ensure that `ktlint` produces code that is compliant
with the style guide and doesn't conflict with `ktfmt`.

There is a
[`ktfmt` IntelliJ plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14912-ktfmt) that
you can install to replace the `Reformat Code` action in IntelliJ IDEs.

### BUILD and Starlark

Bazel includes a
[`Buildifier`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/tree/master/buildifier)
tool.

### Other languages

[`clang-format`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) supports
formatting for multiple languages. Run it with `--style=Google`.

## TODOs

Use TODO comments to point out a desired improvement in the code. Each of these
should be actionable, explaining how it can be resolved and what conditions may
need to be met first.

### Format

TODO comments should be of the format `TODO(<context>): <comment>`, where the
context indicates the person or tracked issue with the most information about
the problem. This is not an assignee.

Prefer referencing an issue rather than a person whenever possible, as a
well-written issue provides permanent history and is usually linked to
additional context.

Here is how to reference people or issues in different systems:

*   Issue in a GitHub repository
    *   `TODO(<org>/<repo>#<number>)`
*   GitHub user
    *   `TODO(@<GitHub username>)`
*   Issue in internal [Google Issue Tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com)
    *   `TODO(b/<issue ID>)`
*   Googler
    *   `TODO(<@google.com username>)`

Note that references to Google systems are only included here to explain any
existing TODOs of this form in the code base. All new TODOs should reference
GitHub.

Example: `TODO(@SanjayVas): Switch Foo to Bar after the Baz dependency is
upgraded to v2.`

This means that if someone wants more information about this TODO, the best
person to ask would be GitHub user @SanjayVas.
