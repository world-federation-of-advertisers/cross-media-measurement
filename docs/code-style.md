# Code Style

Rather than providing a complete style guide, this section outlines some
specific code style issues that tend to come up in code reviews. Besides
familiarizing yourself with these, please feel free to link to particular
sections of this when reviewing others’ code.

## General

*   Code should be thoroughly unit tested:
    *   Test the contract (public API), not the implementation.
        *   Corollary: Internal functionality that is not part of the public API
            should not be exposed just so it can be tested directly.
        *   See
            [Prefer Testing Public APIs Over Implementation-Detail Classes](https://testing.googleblog.com/2015/01/testing-on-toilet-prefer-testing-public.html)
    *   For dependencies in tests, carefully consider when to use fakes, mocks,
        stubs, or the real dependency. See
        [this article](https://testing.googleblog.com/2013/07/testing-on-toilet-know-your-test-doubles.html)
        for definitions and
        [this one](https://testing.googleblog.com/2013/05/testing-on-toilet-dont-overuse-mocks.html)
        for some guidance.
    *   Bias towards more, smaller test cases.
*   Code should be autoformatted and linted
*   Eliminate compiler warnings when practical, using language-appropriate
    suppression annotations as appropriate (with a comment explaining why).
*   Limit usage of unnecessary third party dependencies. Due to the privacy
    requirements of this project, we prefer avoiding unaudited dependencies.

## Conventions

*   Tests go into the `src/test/` tree.
*   Test infrastructure that either is complex enough to warrant being tested
    itself or is used by more than one package goes into a `testing` subpackage
    of the `src/main/` tree, with its Bazel targets marked as `testonly`.
*   All public service APIs (those called by a different component) follow the
    [AIPs](https://aip.dev/), with specific exceptions where noted.
*   Database access is restricted to servers hosting internal APIs.
*   Database internal IDs must not be exposed outside of internal API servers,
    i.e. they are not included in the internal API.
*   The term "reference ID" refers to an ID from an external system.
*   Names of protobuf messages for the serialized portion of a database row end
    in `Details`.

## Languages

### Kotlin

*   Follow the
    [Google Android Kotlin style guide](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/style-guide).
    *   Exception: Use two spaces instead of four for indentation.
*   Use the [Truth](https://truth.dev/) library for test assertions, importing
    `assertThat`.
    *   Make sure to import the [ProtoTruth](https://truth.dev/protobufs)
        version of `assertThat` as well if you have protobuf message subjects.
    *   Exception: Use the `kotlin.test` package for expected exceptions,
        e.g.[`assertFailsWith`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/kotlin.test/kotlin.test/assert-fails-with.html).
*   Prefer using Kotlin DSL builders for protocol buffers. See
    [Kotlin Generated Code](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/kotlin-generated)
    in the Protocol Buffers Developer Guide.
*   Specify types explicitly except when they are obvious.
    *   For example, assignments from constructors or factory functions.
    *   "Superfluous" explicit types are fine except in cases where they clearly
        hurt readability or safety.
*   Use (companion) objects for constants and static properties.
    *   This avoids polluting the global namespace.
    *   This is a light recommendation, as much code has already been written in
        this repository that does not follow this.
*   Avoid defining extensions on common types when it may appear that they could
    work on all instances of that type.
    *   For example, `String.toFoo()` where the String must be a specific
        serialization of a `Foo` to work. This is version of the "stringly
        typed" anti-pattern.
*   Catch `StatusException` from RPCs immediately at the call site.
    *   This prevents gRPC statuses from being incorrectly propagated from gRPC
        servers that are also gRPC clients.
    *   If you need to re-throw the exception to be handled at a higher level,
        wrap it in another exception type.
*   See the
    [Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html)
    when neither this document nor the style guide offer an opinion.

### C++

*   Follow the
    [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
*   Follow [Abseil’s Tips of the Week](http://abseil.io/tips)
*   Don’t rely on transitive includes.
    *   You may be able to use the
        [include-what-you-use](https://include-what-you-use.org) tool to help.

### Bazel BUILD and Starlark

*   Follow the Bazel
    [BUILD style guide](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/build-style.html)
    and
    [.bzl style guide](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/bzl-style.html)
*   Do not rely on transitive dependencies. Include all directly referenced
    dependencies in that target's `deps`.

### Protocol Buffers

Follow the
[Protocol Buffers style guide](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style).

### Markdown

Follow the
[Google Markdown Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/style.html).

Note: We intend to keep our Markdown compatible with both the
[GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/) and
[Gitiles](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gitiles/+/HEAD/Documentation/markdown.md).

## Formatters/Linters

Automated formatters help keep code styling consistent, especially when there
are ambiguities in the style guide. You should run the appropriate formatters on
your code prior to submitting.

### Kotlin

Kotlin formatting is done by
[`ktfmt`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/ktfmt) with the `--google-style`
option. Please keep code `ktfmt`-formatted.

There is a
[`ktfmt` IntelliJ plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14912-ktfmt) that
you can install to replace the `Reformat Code` action in IntelliJ IDEs.

### BUILD and Starlark

Bazel includes a
[`Buildifier`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/tree/master/buildifier)
tool.

### Other languages

[`clang-format`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) supports
formatting for multiple languages. Run it with `--style=Google`.

## TODOs

Use TODO comments to point out a desired improvement in the code. Each of these
should be actionable, explaining how it can be resolved and what conditions may
need to be met first.

### Format

TODO comments should be of the format `TODO(<context>): <comment>`, where the
context indicates the person or tracked issue with the most information about
the problem. This is not an assignee.

Prefer referencing an issue rather than a person whenever possible, as a
well-written issue provides permanent history and is usually linked to
additional context.

Here is how to reference people or issues in different systems:

*   Issue in a GitHub repository
    *   `TODO(<org>/<repo>#<number>)`
*   GitHub user
    *   `TODO(@<GitHub username>)`
*   Issue in internal [Google Issue Tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com)
    *   `TODO(b/<issue ID>)`
*   Googler
    *   `TODO(<@google.com username>)`

Note that references to Google systems are only included here to explain any
existing TODOs of this form in the code base. All new TODOs should reference
GitHub.

Example: `TODO(@SanjayVas): Switch Foo to Bar after the Baz dependency is
upgraded to v2.`

This means that if someone wants more information about this TODO, the best
person to ask would be GitHub user @SanjayVas.
