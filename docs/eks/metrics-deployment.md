# Halo Metrics Deployment on EKS

Getting visibility into CMMS metrics using Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus
and Grafana.

## Background

We can use [Amazon Managed Prometheus (AMP)](https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/)
to collect metrics from EKS cluster and then viewing them in
[Amazon Managed Grafana](https://aws.amazon.com/grafana/) dashboards.
Using OpenTelemetry we can also collect more detailed metrics from CMMS component pods.

The configuration for the [`dev` environment](../../src/main/k8s/dev) can be
used as the basis for deploying CMMS components using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
on another AWS Cloud project.

Many operations can be done either via the `aws` CLI or the AWS web console.
This guide picks whichever is most convenient for that operation. Feel
free to use whichever you prefer.

### What are we creating/deploying?

*   OpenTelemetryCollector
    *   `default`
*   OpenTelemetry Instrumentation
    *   `open-telemetry-java-agent`
*   NetworkPolicy
    *   `opentelemetry-collector-network-policy`

## Before you start

Deploy a Halo component. See the related guides: [Create Duchy Cluster](duchy-deployment.md)


## Create a workspace in Amazon Managed Prometheus

Go to the [Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/home?region=us-east-1#/)
page, and using the `Create` button and follow the instructions to create a new workspace.

Then retrieve the remote write URL endpoint of this workspace from the AWS web console which will be used in later
steps. It will be a URL like `https://aps-workspaces.<region>.amazonaws.com/workspaces/<id>/api/v1/remote_write`

## Create a workspace in Amazon Managed Grafana

Go to the [Amazon Managed Service for Grafana](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/grafana/home?region=us-east-1)
page, and using the `Create` button and follow the instructions to create a new workspace.

Once created, follow this [doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/AMP-onboard-amg.html) to
set up Amazon Managed Grafana for use with Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus

## Set up EKS cluster to send metric to AMP

[AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT)](https://aws-otel.github.io/) is a secure, production-ready, AWS-supported
distribution of the OpenTelemetry project that can help publishing EKS cluster metrics to
Amazon Managed Prometheus. Follow [Install ADOT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/adot-manage.html#adot-install)
doc to create:
* the ADOT addon to the existing EKS cluster
* a service account that allows ADOT addon to publish metrics to Amazon Managed Prometheus

With ADOT addon, EKS cluster can publish metrics to AMP through the remote write url, see [open telemetry config](#opentelemetry-collectors-and-instrumentation)

## Create the K8s Object Configurations

Deploying to the cluster is generally done by applying a K8s object
configuration file. You can use the `dev` configurations as a base to get
started. The `dev` configurations are YAML files that are generated from files
written in [CUE](https://cuelang.org/) using Bazel rules.

You can customize the generated object configuration as-needed.

### OpenTelemetry Collectors and Instrumentation

The default `dev` configuration for OpenTelemetry collection is in
[`open_telemetry_eks.cue`](../../src/main/k8s/dev/open_telemetry_eks.cue), which
depends on [`open_telemetry.cue`](../../src/main/k8s/open_telemetry.cue).

The default build target is `//src/main/k8s/dev:open_telemetry_eks`.

The generated `OpenTelemetryCollector` should have `prometheusremotewrite` exporter similar to:
```yaml
        exporters:
          prometheusremotewrite:
            endpoint: https://aps-workspaces.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/workspaces/ws-65b9edc1-dda8-4037-8464-01eebe0e7651/api/v1/remote_write
            auth:
              authenticator: sigv4auth
```

## Apply the K8s Object Configurations

### Install cert-manager

You must use a [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/),
[OpenTelemetry Operator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/),
and collector image that are compatible with each other. See the
[Compatibility matrix](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator#compatibility-matrix)
and the collector image specified in
[`open_telemetry.cue`](../../src/main/k8s/open_telemetry.cue).

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.11.2/cert-manager.yaml
```

### Install OpenTelemetry Operator

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/releases/download/v0.77.0/opentelemetry-operator.yaml
```

### Apply OpenTelemetry and Prometheus Configurations

You can just use `kubectl apply`, specifying the configuration files you created
in the previous step.

## Restart Deployments to Start Collecting Metrics

You will need to restart all the Deployments to pick up the Java agent
instrumentation.

```shell
for deployment in $(kubectl get deployments -o name); do kubectl rollout restart $deployment; done
```

## View metrics in Amazon Managed Grafana

Once the setup is done, you should be able to view the metrics in Amazon Managed Grafana like:

## Adding Additional Metrics

The above adds OpenTelemetry JVM and RPC metrics. With the above as a base, it 
is possible to add other metrics that can be scraped.
